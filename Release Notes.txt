RELEASE NOTES
-------------

Application: 24 Way Premier Test Jig with RP2040 Processor 
Version:  4.1.2
Release Date: 13/06/2024  
Description:  RP2040 Raspberry Pi Pico board controlling a 24 way Premier 
              sensor jig
Output Files: JigMKIICode.elf (for loading using the Raspberry Pi console)
              JigMKIICode.uf2 (for loading via direct Pico board USB connection)
Platform: Raspberry Pi RP2040
Compiler/Tools: Visual Code 1.73.1 (IDE), GCC C Compiler 11.3.1 (arm-none-eabi)

Changes on this version
-----------------------
	1. The additional byte wait routines called when a message without a 
           position address is received have been commented out 
	2. The watchdog is now called on each call to rxByteMaster and rxByteSlave 
           as the comms code is written in such a way that it is called from
           the main program loop but is blocking and will wait for up to 5 
           seconds for a message to arrive and missed/corrupted messages would
           cause the watchdog to be involved.  Code not fully re-written due to
           fears of introducing unexpected errors as code has to work with
           many legacy products with varients of the current protocol
    3. Output files renamed JigMKIICode.*  rathern than src.*
